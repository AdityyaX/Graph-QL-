# GraphQL Project with Apollo Server and Apollo Client

This project demonstrates how to use Apollo Server for building a GraphQL server and Apollo Client for consuming the GraphQL API on the client-side. It includes a simple example of a GraphQL server with a single query and mutation, and a React application that uses Apollo Client to interact with the server.

## Features

- **Apollo Server**: Set up a GraphQL server using Apollo Server.
- **Apollo Client**: Use Apollo Client to fetch and manage data on the client-side.
- **GraphQL Queries and Mutations**: Define and execute GraphQL queries and mutations.
- **React Application**: Build a simple React application that consumes the GraphQL API.

## Setup

### Server (Apollo Server)

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-graphql-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `server` directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-graphql-project/server
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server should now be running on `http://localhost:8000/graphql`.

### Client (React with Apollo Client)

1. Navigate to the `client` directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-graphql-project/client
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The React application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- Open the React application in your web browser (`http://localhost:3000`).
- Use the provided UI to interact with the GraphQL server.
- Try executing queries and mutations to see the data flow between the client and server.
